## Install
1. Download [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com), install, and open it.
2. After choosing the plugin directory, download the main script of this plugin---[aideadlines.15m.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nzer0/bitbar-aideadlines/master/aideadlines.15m.py)---and put it into that directory.
3. Refresh xbar (Cmd+R).
4. If it displays "Install Dependencies", click it and follow the instructions.
5. Sometimes, BitBar may invoke a different `python` than what is configured for bash. In this case, click "Ammend shebang" from the menu and Refresh it (Cmd+R).

# Notice:
if you have conda, be sure either you changed shebang for the conda environment installed with the dependencies or you have install them without conda
